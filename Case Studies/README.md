# Text Summarization Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates cutting-edge **text summarization techniques** using Python. The notebook explores various approaches and chains for effectively summarizing text data, especially large documents.

## Description

This notebook implements several innovative methods for summarizing text:
- **Prompt Template Text Summarization**: Utilizes customizable prompt templates to summarize documents efficiently.
- **StuffDocumentChain Summarization**: Implements a sequential chain to condense and summarize information.
- **Map-Reduce for Large Documents**: A robust approach to handle and summarize extensive text datasets by breaking them into smaller chunks, summarizing each, and merging results.
- **Refine Chain Summarization**: A refinement-based method to enhance the quality of summaries iteratively.

## Key Techniques Used

Below are the main techniques implemented in the notebook with some snippets of code:

### Prompt Template Summarization
A simple yet flexible technique leveraging templates for consistent summarization tasks.
```python
# Example: Using a prompt template for summarization
template = "Summarize the following text: {input_text}"
```

---

### Map-Reduce Summarization
Efficient for large documents by splitting, summarizing parts, and combining results.
```python
# Example: Map-reduce strategy for summarization
def map_reduce_summarization(text_blocks):
    summaries = [summarize(block) for block in text_blocks]
    return combine_summaries(summaries)
```

---

### Refine Chain
A method that iteratively refines initial summaries to improve accuracy and relevance.
```python
# Example: Refining summaries with iterations
refined_summary = refine(initial_summary, additional_context)
```

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need to install the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
- Other libraries as required in the notebook

## Running the Notebook

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
